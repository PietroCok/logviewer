## Overview

*LogViewer* is a Node.js-based application designed to simplify log monitoring across multiple environments. The application is launched directly from the terminal and provides a seamless way to view and analyze log files. 

Each log entry is color-coded based on its type (such as **Info**, **Debug**, **Warning**, and **Error**) to improve readability and facilitate efficient debugging. Users can customize log colors and define configurations to suit their needs.

### Key Features
- **Environment Management**: Define multiple environments and their respective log files for quick access.
- **Customizable Log Colors**: Use default colors or define your own color scheme for specific keywords in logs.
- **Terminal-based Simplicity**: No graphical interfaceâ€”designed for lightweight and efficient operation in terminal environments.
